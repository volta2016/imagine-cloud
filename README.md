# Planning and Orchestration for Google Cloud Infrastructure

Before configuring the database in **Cloud SQL** and creating the container with its image, I dedicated a full week to orchestrating and planning the entire process. This approach ensured a smooth and efficient implementation.

During this preparation phase, I focused on understanding the core concepts of Google Cloudâ€™s infrastructure:

- **Pricing Models:** Studied the pricing structures to optimize costs based on project requirements.
- **IAM Roles Management:** Configured and assigned secure roles to ensure proper access control for all resources.
- **SDK Configuration:** Set up the Google Cloud SDK for seamless use with Cloud Shell and to enable connections from local machines.
- **Compute Engine:** Analyzed Compute Engine functionalities to efficiently manage and configure virtual machine instances.
- **Cloud SQL:** Planned and configured scalable and high-performing databases in Cloud SQL.
- **Key Tools:** Identified and integrated essential tools to ensure successful project execution.
